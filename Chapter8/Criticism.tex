\section{limitations of work}
*Note to self, Critisism based around not using webservers with IIS. This would have given further details into Request Errors and would have helped to disclude some 'over-banding' principals in risk factors. For example see 400 errors. 

The dates that the IP was reported on is not necessarily the date of the attack. This may flag up historic malign IP addesses if the website owner identifies an old IP with suspicious trends.

It would be have been appropriate to see if the information presented to the user is easily interpreted. In order to assess this UI it would be beneficial to apply some kind of user testing in order to evaluate if the data is inherently too complex for individuals with minimal IT literacy to understand. Unfortunately through time constraints this was not carried out.

%a better way o doing the country might have been to look at the percentage of people with internet access and then map that to the number of attacks.

Following points not implemented during the design phase:

 %--- note 1 crannor: It should be noted however that Crannor did suggest that some novice users may not be 'all that receptive to learning'. This demonstrates that teaching website owners how to use the software may be ineffective. It also suggests that an online tutorial may be inappropriate or not worth implementing.

 
% Crannor stated that 'When a user is unlikely to have relevant insights into which configuration options to choose, well-choosen default settings may result in better security-configurations than most humans would achieve on thier own.' (\cite{cranor2008framework}) This supports the implementation of clear drop down fields and perhaps well choosen default options. for this reason the UI or software options cannot be chaged 
 
 %Noam ben asher 2009: 'Both usability and security are sensitive to similar vulnerabilities during the design, development and testing cycle of a system. In many cases they are regarded as non-functional requirements, and their design process  and implementation occurs after the core functionality was implemented'
 
 %Note that we did not separate request and response times, these were given identical 50% weights, this may have been in hindsight a little uneducated ;D

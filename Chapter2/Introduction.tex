\section*{Introduction}
This chapter will look at the various types of attacks that can occur on websites. Some of these attacks are more serious in nature in comparison to others. A selection of different attacks will be looked at and the detection and prevention of these attacks will be analysed; this will feed into the final research, so that the product can display a risk analysis to the users.  The two main attacks looked at will be low-bandwidth attacks and SQL injection attacks. Other less common attacks will be discussed in lesser detail.

\section{Low-bandwidth attack detection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is a Low-bandwidth attack?
    \item Why are they hard to detect? 
    \item Detection methods
    \item How this will feed into my product
\end{itemize}

A low-rate and low bandwidth attack is a different kind of an attack in comparison to a normal DoS attack. A DoS attack works on overwhelming the server with requests therefore it is easier to detect for example, if you receive a large amount of traffic from a single IP; this is more then likely a DoS attack (REF NEEDED).

\begin{itemize}
    \item It is a protocol attack, so a layer-7 application attack.

\section{port scanning}

A port scanner attack is a attack whereby an attacker will send packages of information to different ports on a server to see which ports can be accessed; this may lead them to be able to log into different parts of the server using a brute force approach. Some of the standard ports that are use d in a web server are WWW 80, ftp 21 and nameserver 53 (REF NEEDED). SSH 22. A lot of web hosts and sever owners change the ports for SSH and the ftp however, they may inevertinbly (how spell) leave ports open that are not secure.

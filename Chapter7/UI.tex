\section{ui testing}

Although the UI is not a major part of the project, it will still be important to check that the UI implemented the functionality required in the system therefore, the UI was tested as the software was being built. All components of the the UI were functional as they were implemented however, when looking back over the software it was found there were some errors in the spelling of words and some text needed rewording to aid the user experience. 

it was noted that the button that is needed to read the file, although this was stated on the button the button is not very clear in how to display the data. It would have been useful to make this button clearer in some way however due to time constraints in this project this would require extensive reworking of the program which time constraints did not allow. By adding the words \textit{start here} to the button; this made the button bigger and provided clear instructions on how to start the process.

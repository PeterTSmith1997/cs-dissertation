It is important to note that a 403 error although not always indicative of a malicious IP request alone, may infact be enhanced by the fact that a website opwner has prior knowledge that the IP of the visitor has been flagged by the website owner as a potentially risky IP. This is a difficult factor to discuss as it is highly dependant upon the knowledge base of the website owner. An example of this can be seen with the IP of 35.187.118.51. The request pattern appeared to be a high number of IP requests over a set period of time. After delving into the dataset deeper, it became apparent that the IP was coming to the website approximately 800 times per day. It is theorised that the website owner has identified this IP address as a potentially malicious visitor, as all of the requests for this IP have returned a 403 error message.
